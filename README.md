CS 1.6 and HALF LIFE server (with amx and metamode for windows)

You can run this server locally to have fun with your friends—just change the IP and port settings and you’re good to go! I know it might seem a bit unnecessary, but setting everything up can be a bit tricky. I took the time to handle the boring parts so you don’t have to :) Have fun, and remember, it’s important to enjoy some laughs with your colleagues from time to time!
